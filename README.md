 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kunal Dwivedi, SMTS as Salesforce
Iâ€™m Kunal, a seasoned software engineer with over 5 years of experience designing and scaling distributed systems. Iâ€™ve worked at companies like Amazon, Samsung, and Salesforce, leading end-to-end architecture for high-performance microservices. With a strong foundation in system design, backend engineering, and low-latency architectures, I specialize in building scalable, resilient, and efficient solutions.

Through To Infinite Scale, I break down complex system design concepts, sharing real-world insights, optimizations, and best practices. Whether itâ€™s caching strategies, database sharding, or designing fault-tolerant services, I aim to help engineers think like architects.
